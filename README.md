##Â Getting set up

It's as easy as forking this repository, change the necessary files and create a Pull Request.

To get started, you will need a mozillians.org API key though. You can get it easily on your mozillians.org profile page:

* Log in to mozillians.org
* Go to your "Edit your profile"
* At the bottom you see "Developer"
* Click on "Manage API keys"
* Register a new app
* Add the resulting API key to the `config.json` file in the root directory of this project.
